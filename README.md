# PDF Summarizer

The PDF summarizer allows the user to input search queries on the pdf files inside the `data` folder, and the AI model will search for the relevant results and give a summary to the user

For this project, I used the Chroma Database to store the compiled data from the PDF files which makes it easier for the Ollama AI model to query and give a brief summary of the documents to the user.

Models required: "nomic-embed-text" and "mistral"
